# Brainfuck2Java
A Brainfuck to Java source compiler.

To use:

java -jar BF2Java.jar "source file" "destination file"
javac "destination file"
java "destination file"

Currently input may not be supported. (I haven't tested it)

This compiler has 3000 total cells, it starts in the middle so programs can use cells both ways. ("Below zero")
